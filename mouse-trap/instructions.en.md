## Mouse trap

### Instructions

Develop a trap to capture the elements when the mouse is getting too close to the center of the page!

- Write the body of the function `createCircle`: make it fire on every click on the page, and create a white circle at the position of the mouse on the screen

- Write the body of the function `moveCircle`: make it fire when the mouse moves, and get the last circle created and makes it move along with the mouse

- A frame is at the center of the page ; when a circle is inside that frame, it has to be purple ; once a circle enters the frame, it is trapped inside and cannot go out of it anymore.
