## Pick & click

### Instructions

Today, you're gonna create your own color picker.

Write the function `pick` which creates a `hsl` color picker varying the `hue` and `luminosity` according to the position of the mouse, which:

- displays the `hue` value in text
- displays the `luminosity` value in text
- displays the full `hsl` value in text
- copies that value in the clipboard on click
- displays two lines, for X and Y axis, following the cursor
